------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROJECT TITLE:
Battleships


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
To convert the real board-game 'BATTLESHIPS' into a computer-based one. But unlike the real game, this one will be played between a human player and the Computer (Artificial Intelligence).


VERSION or DATE:
Date of completion :- 26/12/2015.


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
From the main work-place, right-click on the 'StartGame' icon. A drop-down menu appears. Select the "void main(String[] args)" option (called method call) at top.
Press ENTER.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
After starting the game successfully, when it asked whether you know the rules of the game, enter your relevant choice. Instructions would be displayed if a 'y' is entered that time.


LIMITATIONS:
1)  The game takes a while to get a hang of, if the player is playing it for a first time.
2)  The AI is not able to hit in an exactly realistically replicabe style. But this is counteracted by the ability of the player to be able to guess in an intelligent pattern, but the AI's inability to do the same as it guesses randomly.
3)  The plans for the AI to guess were to guess in a grid-like manner initially, but due to lack of time, it failed to be impemented very successfully and so, was scrapped off the code. Now, the AI guesses randomly.
4)  Even though, the game speed has been set for an average reader and based upon average attention span, the game speed may not be able to cannot accomodate very slow-readers.
5)  While inputing into the 'pause' method, inputing anything but a number stops the execution as it throws an Exception.


ADDED FEATURES:
1)  A Timer/Pause-time function can be used anytime during the player's turn.
2)  Statistics regarding the hit-miss percentile, hit-miss chances, can be displayed anytime during the player's turn.
3)  A sequence of guesses can be entered with a "space" for sequetial evaluation. The Computer plays its turns continuosly in that case, but still alternately. Eg: [a1 b3 f10 g6] | [ENTER] can be entered, but after that, can't be changed.
